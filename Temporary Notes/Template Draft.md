## **General Template:**

*Temporary Notes* don't need a template. This is a general blueprint for *Permanent Notes*, other types of notes such as *Tags*, *System Documentation*, *Indexes*, etc. would need a modified template.

Have a special tag or way to find indexes, bonus if it's visible in the graph view, rather than a different folder for indexes.

It would likely need to be altered per folder/area, a system to automate customization is preferer able. Create automation to automatically ask for a title when creating a note.

The more metadata the better.

Consider footnote elements such as *see also*, *remarks*, *references*, etc.

- Consider a *Table of Contents*
- What should be added inside the *YAML Header*? Some examples:
	- File creation date
	- Last modified
	- Location
	- Size
	- Word count
	- Alias
	- Tags
	- Topic
	- Subject
	- Token count (remember this is also for AI)
