## Overview

The **Longevity Research Initiative** is an interdisciplinary project focused on making biological aging **optional** through biogerontology, neuroscience, computational biology, and regenerative medicine research.

This repository is a **knowledge base** and **collaborative platform** for longevity science.

### Core Focus Areas

**Biochemistry** - Investigating cellular metabolism, oxidative stress, and epigenetics to regulate lifespan.

**Biogerontology** - Studying cellular senescence, telomere dynamics, and longevity genetics to extend healthy aging.

**Neuroscience** - Enhancing neuroplasticity, synaptic regeneration, and brain mapping for cognitive longevity.

**Biomedical Engineering** - Advancing regenerative medicine, bioprinting, and gene editing for tissue and organ renewal.

**Computer Science** - Applying AI, neural networks, and computational neuroscience to model and optimize aging interventions.
